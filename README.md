# Module-12RMarkdown
For this assignment, the last "regular" assignment before the final project at the end of the year, we were asked to take functions we were building for our final project and present them in a R Markdown document using the readings provided. While my proposal for my final project has yet to be approved I have created some functions in order to make sure I'm working on it, and so I followed instructions and created an .rmd file through Rstudios and wrote them down into it. I then used my knowledge of markdown to write a description of what the functions were for and what they were intended to do, and then used a combination of my prexisting knowledge and the information provided through the readings to create proper headings. I then made sure to properly format the code blocks, running into some trouble near the end until I realized I had managed to put the "backticks" in the grey ("highlighted") section of the code and that was why it was refusing to knit due to a "attempt to use zero-length variable name" error. At this point I was then able to create the acompanying word document.
